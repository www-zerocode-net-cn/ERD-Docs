description: ðŸ’¥ Manually installing Custom Apps.
---

Inject custom apps to Spotify and access them in left sidebar.  
Add your desired custom app folder names in config, separated them by `|` character.  
Example:

```ini
[AdditionalOptions]
...
custom_apps = reddit|yourownapp
```

App folders can be stored in:

- `CustomApps` folder in Home directory:

| Platform            | Path                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Windows**         | `%userprofile%\.spicetify\CustomApps\` |
| **Linux**/**MacOS** | `~/.config/spicetify/CustomApps`       |

- `CustomApps` folder in Spicetify executable directory.

If there are 2 apps having same name, app in Home directory is prioritized.

- [Reddit](#reddit)
